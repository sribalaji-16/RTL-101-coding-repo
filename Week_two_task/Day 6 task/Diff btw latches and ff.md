Latches

Triggering Mechanism: Latches are level-triggered, meaning their output changes as soon as the input changes, provided the enable signal is active.
Control Signal: Latches are controlled by an enable signal and do not require a clock signal.
Operation Type: Latches are used in asynchronous circuits, where the output can change immediately with the input.
Speed and Power: Latches generally operate faster and consume less power compared to flip-flops.
Usage: Latches are often used for temporary data storage and simple memory elements.

Flip Flop

Triggering Mechanism: Flip-flops are edge-triggered, meaning their output changes only at specific moments, such as the rising or falling edge of a clock signal.
Control Signal: Flip-flops require a clock signal to control when the output can change.
Operation Type: Flip-flops are used in synchronous circuits, where changes occur in sync with the clock signal.
Speed and Power: Flip-flops are more robust and stable, making them suitable for more complex operations, though they generally consume more power and operate slower than latches.
Usage: Flip-flops are used in more complex memory elements, registers, and sequential circuits.
