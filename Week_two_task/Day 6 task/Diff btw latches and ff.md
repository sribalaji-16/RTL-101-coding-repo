Latches

Triggering Mechanism: Latches are level-triggered, meaning their output changes as soon as the input changes, provided the enable signal is active.
Control Signal: Latches are controlled by an enable signal and do not require a clock signal.
Operation Type: Latches are used in asynchronous circuits, where the output can change immediately with the input.
Speed and Power: Latches generally operate faster and consume less power compared to flip-flops.
Usage: Latches are often used for temporary data storage and simple memory elements.
